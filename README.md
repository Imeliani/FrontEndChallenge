# FrontEndChallenge
Shopify FrontEndChallenge
This was my take on the spacetagram challeneg, i added a share button and made a heart likem icon, although it is not exactly animated. 
I was a bit under a time comstranint since i only started this the 19th and also had school and assigments ot submit, but i still managed to add all the functionalities

The interface could be made to look nicer, however i was abit short on time
